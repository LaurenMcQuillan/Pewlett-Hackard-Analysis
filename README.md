# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine who will be retiring soon from Hewlett Packard by title so they can be prepared to fill open positions and determine how many retirement packages they will need to offer. The retiring employees were found based on their date of birth.  Employees born between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955 are considered of retirement age. Additionally, they wanted to know which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Employees born between 1/1/1965 and 12/31/1965 are considered eligible for the mentorship program. Hewlett Packard provided csv files containing employee data, which I was able to use to build a database and writes queries using SQL to complete the analysis.

## Results

* 

* The title that has the most employees expected to retire is Senior Engineer, followed by Senior Staff. Senior employees are likely to be high valued with the most experience, so itâ€™s very beneficial to plan ahead for their retirement.
